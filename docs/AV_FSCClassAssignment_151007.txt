FEDERAL SUPPLY 
CLASS ASSIGNMENTS
FEDERAL SUPPLY CLASS (FSC) ASSIGNMENTS TO DLA/GSA FOR 
INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT 
Each item in the Federal Supply System is assigned to a specific Source of Supply (SOS) for 
management. The following FSCs indicate that either DLA or GSA has been designated as the 
integrated materiel manager at the wholesale level for one or more consumable items of supply 
in the FSC. Source of supply must be determined for individual NSNs to route 
MILSTRIP/FEDSTRIP documents or obtain information on that specific item. Source of supply 
is contained in the Consolidated Management Data List (ML-C Basic) available through your 
service/agency publication point. Telephone numbers for the sources of supply are provided at 
Part I of this handbook. Table 1 is a list of FSC assignments to DLA/GSA sorted by FSC. Table 
2 is a list of FSC assignments to DLA/GSA sorted alphabetically by description.
